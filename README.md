# Remarkable Glitch App

## Get Started
1. Remix the project
2. **IMPORTANT!** Set _Project permissions_ to 'Private' (in the Share modal). Your project database will contain your Remarkable token, which is equivalent to a password to all your files; do not share the project with anyone you wouldn't share your password with.
3. Set an environment variable in .env: SESSION_SECRET=\< a random string \>
4. In the project menu, open the _live site_ URL in your browser. Follow the link to connect your Remarkable token.
5. Update your preferred settings in <code>src/controllers/intern.js</code>, then load \<your site\>/intern/setconfig to update.
